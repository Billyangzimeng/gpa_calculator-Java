IMPORTANT MESSAGES ABOUT THE COURSE PLANNER:

1. Different course have different (100 points) grading scales, therefore all grades are entered based on the LetterGrade, 4.0 scale.
	(For instance A and above is a 4.0, A- is a 3.7, B+ is a 3.3... so and so forth, per UVA grading policy)
	(User will enter their letter grade as either decimals or integers)
	
2. User can enter course with a name, credit hours, and grade.
	*--If enter with all three fields, a course will be added with the specified fields
	*--If entered with only credit hours, a default "A New Course" will created with the given credit hour
	*--If entered with only credit hours and grade, an "Unknown Course" will be created 
	*--If entered with only credit hours and name, a known course will be created without a grade, 
		and generally considered as a default "A New Course"
	--If entered with nothing, a default "A New Course" will be created
	*CREDIT HOUR MUST BE ENTERED ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE FIELD IN ORDER TO COMPLETE A SUBMISSION
	**NO SUBMISSION CAN BE ACCPETED IF ENTER ONLY WITH A NAME, GRADE, OR BOTH
	**A DEFAULT COURSE HAS THE NAME "A NEW COURSE" AND A GRADE OF "0"
	
3. In order to calculate a required GPA, there must be a minimum of one course entered in the list, and a target GPA.
